README - Lab 8 (SQL & PHP)

- In this lab I practiced designing databases, modifying tables, inserting data, and writing SQL queries.
- I created the required tables (students, courses, grades) and ensured proper use of primary/foreign keys.
- I added fields using ALTER TABLE.
- I inserted sample entries for students, courses, and grades.
- I performed join queries to list students with grades above 90 and used GROUP BY to compute averages and counts.
- All SQL commands and MySQL outputs are included in my submission document.
- Everything was run on my local Apache/MySQL setup using XAMPP.


This lab helped me understand how SQL databases actually fit together by creating the schema myself and seeing how each table relates through primary and foreign keys. Adding fields and modifying the structure made me appreciate how important proper planning is when designing a database.

Running the different queries gave me hands-on practice pulling meaningful information from the data instead of just viewing tables. Overall, this lab made SQL feel much more intuitive and gave me confidence for future backend work.

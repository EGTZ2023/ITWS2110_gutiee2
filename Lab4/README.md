"Build a basic web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches and displays the current weather in Troy, NY. Use the OpenWeatherMap API and just show the city, temperature, weather description, and icon."

"openweathermap api key is ec6133454d4097e3c4f6d404696cf17f"

"Now add another element. Below the weather display, integrate a second free API that shows a random cat picture each time the page is loaded. Keep the styling minimal for now."

"Modify css to include the cat image in a separate section below the weather."

"The functionality is good, but fix the page styling. Modify css to give it a clean, professional look. Use a modern font, a neutral color scheme, and organize the weather and the cat picture into separate 'cards' with soft shadows."

"Fix weather card. Make the temperature number the main focus by increasing font size. Also, neatly format city name and weather description"
